- Since pupils dilate to allow more light into the eye in low-light environments, do they also dilate for psychological reasons to try to allow in as much information as possible? Could this be a by-product of evolution? Is it possible that when we attend to things that elicit positive emotions or are trying to learn new information through concentration, we are trying to gather as much relevant information as possible, just as we are trying to gather relevant information about the environment when we are in poorly lit areas?

- What are some examples of empirical findings which would support or counter the position that cognition is organized as a modular system?

## Troy Steiner

- Is there an analogous theory of the opponent process theory of color that focuses on the physical shape of an object? In other words, are there physical patterns that are complimentary and those that are antagonistic? If so, what are the optical illusions associated with this phenomenon?
- According to the physical Gestalt, a sphere is a shape at equilibrium with the minimal energy costâ€” if this is true, than could it be assumed that a sphere is the least demanding shape to process?

## Anya Yu

- What is the neural pathway for a visual detection task in blind sight patients? Could it be that their brain plasticity allowed them to adapt to whatever damage the patients sustained before to achieve a certain level of vision perception? Furthermore, seeing that blind sight patients are common in that they perform above chance level in visual tasks but do not experience awareness of sight, could it be that the locus of damage in this case is functionally responsible for some form of consciousness rather than sight itself?

- Since there's a topographical mapping projected from retina to striate cortex, I was thinking that after counting in the distortion of this topographical transformation, is it possible for us to get what the retina has perceived by analyzing excitation patterns of occipital nerves? If not, what are the possible barriers?
